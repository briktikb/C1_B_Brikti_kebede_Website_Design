        During the ceremonies of Timkat, the Tabot, a model of the Ark of the Covenant, which is present on every
        Ethiopian altar (somewhat like the Western altar stone), is reverently wrapped in rich cloth and borne in 
        procession on the head of the priest.The Tabot, which is otherwise rarely seen by the laity, represents
        the manifestation of Jesus as the Messiah when he came to the Jordan for baptism. The Divine Liturgy is
        celebrated near a stream or pool early in the morning (around 2 a.m.). Then the nearby body of water is blessed
        towards dawn and sprinkled on the participants, some of whom enter the water and immerse themselves, symbolically
        renewing their baptismal vows.

        Timkat is widely celebrated across Ethiopia, but the biggest and most spectacular Timkat celebrations take
        place in the historic city of Gondar.By noon on Timqat Day a large crowd has assembled at the ritual site,
        those who went home for a little sleep having returned, and the holy ark is escorted back to its church
        in colorful procession and festivities. The clergy, bearing robes and umbrellas of many hues, perform
        rollicking dances and songs; the elders march solemnly with their weapons, attended by middle-aged men 
        singing a long-drawn, low-pitched haaa hooo; and the children run about with sticks and games.<br>

        Dressedup in their finest, the women chatter excitedly on their one real day of freedom in the year. The young
        raves leap up and down in spirited dances, tirelessly repeating rhythmic songs. This celebration is also
        registered in UNESCO as an intangible heritage. When the holy ark has been safely restored to its dwelling
        -place, everyone goes home for feasting

        The other famous celebration in Ethiopia is Irreecha.Irreecha (also called Irreessa or Dhibaayyuu), is 
        thanksgiving holiday of the Oromo people in Ethiopia. The Oromo people celebrate Irreecha to thank 
        Waaqa (God) for the blessings and mercies they have received throughout the previous year. The Irreecha
        festival is celebrated every year at the beginning of Birraa (Spring), new season after the dark and 
        rainy winter season. It is attended by hundreds of thousands people. The thanksgiving is celebrated
        at sacred lakes across Oromia and Hora Harsadi, Bishoftu, Oromia as a whole. Once at the lake, festival-
        goers immerse the green grass and the flowers they are carrying and sprinkle themselves.

        Many people interpreted the Irrecha festival of the Oromo people, as a festival of difficulty period
        between the month of June and September. But the reality is not as many as exaggerated today. But the 
        Irrecha festival of the festival of welcoming the expected seeds and friutes of prosperity, and peace. 
        The Oromo people also consider the winter rainy season of June to September is a time of difficulty for
        communications, with families, friends due to heavy rain which could cause swelling rivers and floods 
        that may drown people, cattle, crop, and flood homes. Also, family relationships will suffer during 
        winter rain as they can't visit each other because of swelling rivers. In addition, winter time could
        be a time of hunger for some because of the fact that the previous harvest collected in January is 
        running short and the new harvest is not ripe yet. Because of this, some families may endure food
        shortages during the winter. In Birraa (Spring in Oromoland), this shortage ends as many food crops
        especially maize is ripe and families can eat their fill. Other crops like potato, barley, etc. will 
        also be ripe in Birraa. Some disease types like malaria also break out during rainy winter time. 
        Because of this, the Oromos see winter as a difficult season. It does not mean the Oromo people hate 
        rain or the winter season at all. Even when there is a shortage of rain, they pray to Waaqa (God) for
        rain.
